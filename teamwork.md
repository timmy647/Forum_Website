# Iteration2 – Teamwork

For implementing iteration 2, we start by following the plan made in iteration 1 as a basic plan for this milestone. At the beginning we roughly listed out all of the tasks and decide the priority of the tasks and posted them on the task board.

Task | Estimate time | Priority
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Code Implementation | 1 week for writing, 0.5 week for debugging and testing | :star: :star: :star:
Assurance| Note taking during implementing code, 0.5 week for summarising | :star: :star:
Teamwork | Note taking during implementing code, 0.5 week for summarising | :star:

Then we got the details of the iteration 2 and planning the whole process in detail.
For the coding part, same as the last iteration there are 32 functions in total, so we divided them in 4 logical parts and ordered by the importance priority and allocated them to each of the team members.

For assurance, we let each team member to read through the specification and let each team member write down their basic assurance in google docs. By thoroughly acknowledge of the whole iteration, we made up our first meeting to plan the details of the progress. In this meeting we've made a much detailed plan with a meeting schedule.

Date | Task | To do before next meeting
------------ | ------------- | -------------
10.15 | Implementing the code of each part, bring up any assurance. | <ul><li>Deal with token, jwt global etc.</li><li>Write down acceptance criteria based on user stories.
10.18 | Implementing the code of each part | <ul><li>Continue on writing the main body of the code.
10.20 | Implementing the code of each part | <ul><li>Finish on writing the main body of the code, adding notes</li><li>Write down any Verification and Validation.
10.22 | Running tests via pylint | <ul><li>Debug any error in occurred in Pylint.
10.23 | Working on front end and running tests via postman | <ul><li>Debug any error in occurred in postman.</li><li>(*Front end cancelled*)
10.25 | Summarising assumptions & slightly fixing code | <ul><li>Look at each other’s code and make some improvement.
10.26 | Summarising codes & summarising teamwork, preparing on demonstration | <ul><li>Edit into .md file and push on GitLab

During the meeting In addition to completing the various sections, team members also provide help and support each other. Our team members not only have a deep understanding of the parts for which we are responsible, but we also have an understanding of what team members must do to complete the next part. In order to make sure we are all on the right track, we’ve made up a ‘To do’ list to write down any changes or anything did not go to plan, and solve them before the end of next meeting.

In everyone’s own time, we solve the remaining task left in the ‘To do’ section, and post every question and new on the task board to let each other notice. We also regularly share updated work information, which allows us to be consistent and always on time. Thanks to the group members' chats and the questions, it is much more convenient and directly to ask the group members than post on forum/help session, so we can improve a lot through this iteration and finally make a nice result.

Furthermore if there are any questions we cannot solve by ourselves we’ve let each of our team members to go to the help session provided timely to keep on track and on time, that there’s not too much is left over after each meeting. 

After every team member finishing their own work we used GitLab to push it to our own branches and look at each other’s code to make improvements in order to make sure the whole project performances in the right way. By using pylint, postman etc. the problems in our code is directly shown that we are able to solve them.
