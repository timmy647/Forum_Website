Timing and outcome of the team meeting

Due to the time factor, such as schedule mismatch, our group did not have plenty of time to have meetings often and the work was slightly delayed. Still we had several meetings and each team member was assigned different tasks although we didn?t really come up with the best plan. We got each team member's perspective on the project and the goals they wanted to achieve. We discussed some parts during the team meeting, in that way, we could have a good interaction with each member, and each of us could also have a clear idea about each part of the project. 


Responsibilities allocated across the team

Before we started writing code, we first determine the goals of the group. In iteration one, there are four parts of users, channels, information and permissions. We try to assign a large part to each member, and then each person could complete each of the small aspects. Then, we discussed the assigned tasks. In addition to completing the individual parts, the team members also provided help and support to each other. We not only have a deep understanding of the part that we are responsible for, but also have an understanding of what the team members need to complete in order to complete the next part.

Reflection on areas for improvement

The effective meeting really matters, we should determine whether we really need a meeting, meetings should never be held for the sole purpose of sharing information, that?s what email, group chats are for. Meetings should mainly focus on solving problems, each members should have some decent problem that need different opinions. And the better way to improve is brainstorming and one on one meetings between team leader, and report the problems. The way to make the group collaborate better is that each member should ask themselves or leader "What else would you like to see our team achieve that we don?t have someone owning?? Identify areas of additional responsibility that would make a direct impact and  make sure the questions are as specific as possible. 

Impression that team worked together collaboratively

The collaboration of our group went quite well, team members responded positively to group chat, words like ?Here?s one thing need to be mentioned? always appear on the chat, which is good. Also our team members continuously seeking, embracing and applying feedback, makes the work goes smoothly.

How did we work through team disagreement or tension

The disagreement or tension between team members is not a bad thing, on the other hand, conflict avoidance is bad for a group, when people sweep the question under the rug, it doesn?t mean that the issues have been solved, it lose the opportunity that the group could create the innovation. take risks and do some conflict debt is actually helpful for a team. We have some differences in the process of completing the code, such as understanding the code requirements and writing test files. Because of differences, we can do a lot of discussion. In the discussion of the code requirements, we understand how the code works and how to link the parts written by other team members.
